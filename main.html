<p>
    Bucky's Grounds is a first person Playstation X style<br>
    horror game where you uncover the mysterious disappearance<br>
    of the workers of Riverfall Initiative, all while collecting<br>
    chocolates, and avoiding the sweet toothed<br>
    rabbit who despises yellow light.<br>
</p>
<br>
<h2>Story</h2>
<p>
    Play as Mark, an employee at Riverfall Initiative, who has embarked on a<br>
    mission to uncover the dark truth of a mysterious town within another<br>
    dimension, Kanchoban. Children who go to the Kanchoban Playground never<br>
    come back, and the team sent out to search for them have dissappeared as<br>
    well without a trace. Meet Bucky, the rabbit mascot of the playground,<br>
    who welcomes everyone to play and have fun in his domain. However,<br>
    it seems things have gone awry in the playground, and Bucky and his<br>
    friends arent here to play anymore... They're hungry for another<br>
    victim, and you are their target...<br>

<h2>Development</h2>
<p>
    Bucky's Grounds originally started as a small project for a <br>
    short horror game. We've always found joy in giving<br>
    players polished horror experiences. We aimed to do the same<br>
    with the full game of Bucky's Grounds.<br>
